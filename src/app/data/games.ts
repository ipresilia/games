Each time that Ganon resurfaced, he was defeated by Princess Zelda, who descended from the Goddess Hylia with the help of her champion. Over time, Hyrule managed to mature into an advanced civilization. Using their knowledge of technology, they decided to prepare themselves for Ganon's inevitable return by creating four massive animal-like machines called the Divine Beasts, as well as an army of autonomous, mechanical weapons, called Guardians. Upon Ganon's return, four great warriors were each given the titles of champions and tasked with piloting one of the Divine Beasts to attack and weaken him, while the princess and her hero used the Guardians to protect them while the hero struck Ganon down with the Master Sword, allowing the princess to seal Ganon away.",

While the inventor is out of the room, a group of Rabbids arrive in their Time Washing Machine, one of which puts on the SupaMerge helmet and starts causing chaos. The helmet soon hits the Time Washing Machine and causes a malfunction, sucking the Rabbids and Beep-O into an interdimensional vortex. At that time, another vortex appears above the Mushroom Kingdom, sucking up everyone including Mario and his friends. As both Mario's friends and the Rabbids are thrown across the Mushroom Kingdom, Beep-O discovers that the SupaMerge helmet has merged itself with the Rabbid wearing it, who starts causing more chaos by merging more things together. While most of the merged Rabbids end up becoming hostile, Mario and Beep-O end up encountering two good Rabbids: Rabbid Luigi and Rabbid Peach. Aided by a mysterious e-mail contact known only as F.B., the four decide to team up to put a stop to the chaos.",
